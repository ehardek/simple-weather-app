# A Simple Weather App

This is a simple weather app that was built using HTML & CSS as markup and Javascript for its functionality. The first time I attempted this I was only able to get the current forecast to work. Now I have a lot more functionality like a recent searches and the 8-Day Forecast.

### How to Use: 

To use the application type the name of a City and State in the United States. Be sure to type the city and state like this: "Toledo,Ohio".
